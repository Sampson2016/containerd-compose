# containerd-compose (WIP)

**containerd-compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. 
With **containerd-compose**, you use a YAML file (e.g. the docker-compose.yml) to configure your application's services. 
Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

This is not **docker-compose** it extra features for ***containerd***.
